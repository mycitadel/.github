### MyCitadel Wallet

The main application of the suite is Bitcoin and RGB multisig wallet. It enables real-world usage of **bitcoin, digital assets and bitcoin finance (#BiFi)**, including reliable hodling (with inheritance options), corporate & organization use. Technically it can work with *hardware, air gapped, cold and server-side hot key storage*, involving arbitrary complex time-lock scripts and wide interoperability (because of use of *wallet descriptors*). MyCitadel is a taproot-enabled wallet from day one, including multisig- and script-based taproot.

MyCitadel Wallet was the first consumer-facing wallet supporting taproot scripts with timelocks & miniscript, and the first wallet working with [RGB smart contracts](https://github.com/RGB-WG).

The wallet suite includes the following existing and future consumer-facing apps:
- [Desktop app](https://github.com/mycitadel/mycitadel-flutter) for Linux, Windows and MacOS;
- [Legacy desktop app](https://github.com/mycitadel/mycitadel-desktop) for Linux, Windows and MacOS (Bitcoin-only);
- [Mobile app for Apple platforms](https://github.com/mycitadel/mycitadel-swiftui): MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and visionOS;
- Android mobile app (work in progress);
- **[MyCitadel Node](https://github.com/mycitadel/mycitadel-node)** - server-side daemon supporting operations in company/organization/multi-device setups and used for running Lightning-based services;
- **MyCitadel Box** - personal server appliance running MyCitadel Node;
- **MyCitadel Cloud** - subscription-based cloud service providing MyCitadel Node as a virtual machine in the private cloud;


[^ack]: MyCitadel suite is based on the [LNP/BP Labs](https://github.com/LNP-BP) libraries.
